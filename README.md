# SPOTIFY DATA ANALYSIS IN R
Everybody likes music. Everyone is hooked to some or the other kind of music be it jazz, melody, pop or rock music. There are people who like both high tempo music and sweet slow acoustic music. Certain characteristics of a song make it likeable to people such as Energy, Danceability, Acoustiness, etc. These can also be called the attributes of a song. So, here we are going to analyze these attributes and thus have a better understanding on 
1. The features of a song track 
2. What makes a song lovable?

##	OBJECTIVE
a)	General Objective 
Our general objective behind doing this project is to determine what features and which type of songs do a majority of the music audience love and the reason behind its popularity. 

b)	Specific Objective 
Main objectives of this project are: 
1. To determine the popularity index’s distribution 
2. To analyze the attributes of a song which make it likeable 
3. To gain an understanding of the popular tunes based on the above-mentioned analysis


## APPROACH/ METHODOLOGY
Here in this project, we are going to undergo various stages to conduct this analysis. They are: 

1.	Data Collection 
Collecting data/information from various sources is the first step. This can be done by using a data set either our own personal music library or can be taken from available data on the internet. 

2.	Data Preparation 
So, in the data that we have collected, we have included various audio attributes, some of which are briefly described below: 
• Loudness - The loudness of a song track, measured in decibels (Db).Its value range from -60 to 0 Db. 
• Energy - It represents a measure of intensity and activity. Basically, as high an energy of a song track is, the song tracks feel more fast and loud. Its measure ranges from 0 to 1.
• Danceability - Analyzing on the basis of certain elements of music such as rhythm, beats and tempo, how much does a particular song track make us feel like dancing? Its measure ranges from 0.0 (meaning least danceable) to 1.0(meaning most danceable).  
• Key - Key basically refers to the pitch of a song track. This measured using integers which point out to pitches on the basis of the Standard Pitch Class notation. 
• Tempo - Tempo of a track is measured in beats per minute. Tempo is simply the pace of a given chunk of song track. 
• Liveness - Liveness refers to the probability that a particular song track was performed live. It means it determines the presence of audience. 
• Acousticness - This is a measure of confidence in the song track. Its measure ranges from 0 to 1.0.
